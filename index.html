      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p> As a child, I have always been intrigued by anything that required solving, like maths for example or a game of chess. 
        I enjoyed feeding my curiousity and challenging myself when it came to many things and now consider myself a critical thinker
        with analytical skills. Becoming a web developer feels like a natural carrer path for me and only solidified when I researched and 
        explored the field and its many offerings. Not only is it a fast growing field, it has an abundance of oppertunitites that I believe 
        I can contribute greatly to as well as benefit from. </p>
